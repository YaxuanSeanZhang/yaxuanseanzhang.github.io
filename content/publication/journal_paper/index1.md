abstract: Gender differences in travel patterns have been extensively studied in transportation realm. Recent studies have started to adopt an intersectional lens to examine gender and travel, acknowledging that the convergence of gender and other social identities creates a person’s unique travel experiences. However, studies often focus on gender disparities in trip characteristics and fail to capture the interrelationships of activities and trips throughout the day. And to address intersectionality, existing studies often divide people into groups based on gender and 1 or 2 other characteristics and compare their travel behaviors. So, study findings are restricted by these predefined intersectional groups. Therefore, this study applies the sequence alignment method (SAM) to extract behavior patterns accounting for both trips and activities in daily schedules. Then, this study applies the CHAID (Chi-square automatic interaction detection) method to account for all person-level characteristics and their combined impacts on people’s travel patterns. Last, this study examines the intersectionality nature of gendered travel patterns using statistical tests. To demonstrate the methods and results, the study uses travel survey data collected in greater Minnesota as a study case. The analysis reveals gender differences in travel patterns, such as women starting to lose their after-work personal time after having kids. The CHAID analysis identifies key person-level characteristics that significantly shape travel behavior patterns such as employment status on weekdays and age on weekends. These findings suggests that our proposed methods can address the intersectionality nature of social identities and provide novel insights into gender differences in transportation needs.
